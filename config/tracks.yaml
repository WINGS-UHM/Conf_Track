# Purpose of this file:
# 1) Define the canonical subject taxonomy for the tracker (what shows in the subject dropdown).
# 2) Provide alias strings for normalizing messy/free-text categories from different sources
#    into a small, stable set of canonical labels.
#
# Conventions:
# - `label` is the canonical display name (what you want to end up in conferences.json `sub`).
# - `aliases` are alternative spellings/names that should be mapped into this label.
